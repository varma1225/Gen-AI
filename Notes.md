**Generative AI**

 **Gen AI**
 
 Generative AI is an AI system that generates new content like text, images, or code based on patterns learned from existing data

 **Intelligence** :Intelligence is the ability to learn, understand, think, solve problems, and adapt to new situations.

 **Artifical Intelligence**:Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.


**Machine Learning (ML)**

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML

1.Supervised Learning – Labeled data (Classification, Regression)

2.Unsupervised Learning – Unlabeled data (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)

3.Reinforcement Learning – Learning through rewards and penalties

**Deep Learning (DL)**

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns from large data.

Used in:Image recognition,Speech recognition,Natural language processing

**NEURAL NETWORKS**

A Neural Network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain that learns patterns from data using interconnected layers of artificial neurons.
🔹 Structure of a Neural Network

      1.Input Layer – Receives data

      2.Hidden Layer(s) – Learns patterns

      3.Output Layer – Gives final result
      

**Tokens**

A token is the smallest unit of text that an AI model processes

Ex: i am varma  here tokens are [i , am , varma]

**Transformers**

Transformers can process an entire sentence in one go instead of reading words one by one, because they use self-attention to look at all tokens simultaneously.

**Parallelsim**

Performing computation at simultaneoulsy rather sequentially ( reading a sentence at one go rather reading word by word)

**Embeddings**

embeddings are dense numeric vectors that represent text (words, sentences, documents) or other data (images, audio) in a format that computers can reason about. Think of them as points in a high-dimensional space where similar content is closer together.

Embeddings  are the GPS coordinates oof a word

**Dimensions**

When text is converted into an embedding, it becomes a vector of numbers.

Each number = one dimension.

[0.12, -0.44, 0.89, 0.01, ...]  ← each value is one dimension

Text → 384 to 3072
Voice → 192 to 512
Image → 512 to 1024




So,

128-dim embedding → 128 numbers

384-dim embedding → 384 numbers

768-dim embedding → 768 numbers

1536-dim embedding → 1536 numbers
