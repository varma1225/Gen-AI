Generative AI

 ** Gen AI**:Generative AI is an AI system that generates new content like text, images, or code based on patterns learned from existing data

 **Intelligence** :Intelligence is the ability to learn, understand, think, solve problems, and adapt to new situations.

 **Artifical Intelligence**:Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.


**Machine Learning (ML)**

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML

1.Supervised Learning – Labeled data (Classification, Regression)

2.Unsupervised Learning – Unlabeled data (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)

3.Reinforcement Learning – Learning through rewards and penalties

**Deep Learning (DL)**

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns from large data.

Used in:Image recognition,Speech recognition,Natural language processing

**Tokens**

A token is the smallest unit of text that an AI model processes

Ex: i am varma  here tokens are [i , am , varma]

**Transformers**

Transformers can process an entire sentence in one go instead of reading words one by one, because they use self-attention to look at all tokens simultaneously.
